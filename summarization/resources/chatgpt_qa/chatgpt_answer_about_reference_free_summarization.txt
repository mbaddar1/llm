Evaluating text summarization without a human-generated reference summary requires **reference-free** (intrinsic) evaluation metrics. Here are some key approaches:

### **1. Information Retention & Faithfulness**
- **QA-Based Evaluation** – Check if the summary can correctly answer key questions about the source text.
- **FactScore / QAFactEval** – Uses a question-answering model to check factual consistency.
- **Summac** – Measures factual consistency using natural language inference (NLI).

### **2. Semantic Similarity & Relevance**
- **BERTScore** – Computes similarity between original and summarized text using contextual embeddings.
- **MoverScore** – Measures semantic similarity using Word Mover’s Distance on deep embeddings.
- **TextRank / LexRank Overlap** – Checks if important sentences in the source appear in the summary.

### **3. Compression & Redundancy**
- **Compression Ratio** – Measures how much the summary condenses the original text.
- **Repetition / Relevance Score** – Detects redundant phrases using n-gram overlap or model-based similarity.

### **4. Coherence & Fluency**
- **Perplexity (from a Language Model)** – Evaluates how fluent the summary is.
- **Entity Grid Models** – Measures coherence based on how entities appear across sentences.

## **Tools & Libraries for Implementation**

### **1. Information Retention & Faithfulness**
- **[QAFactEval](https://github.com/salesforce/QAFactEval)**
  - Install: `pip install qafacteval`

- **[Summac](https://github.com/tingofurro/summac)**
  - Install: `pip install summac`
  - Example usage:
    ```python
    from summac.model_summac import SummaCZS
    model = SummaCZS(granularity="sentence", model_name="vitc")
    score = model.score(["source text"], ["summary"])
    print(score)
    ```

### **2. Semantic Similarity & Relevance**
- **[BERTScore](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score)**
  - Install: `pip install bert-score`
  - Example usage:
    ```python
    from bert_score import score
    P, R, F1 = score(["summary"], ["source text"], lang="en", model_type="microsoft/deberta-xlarge-mnli")
    print(F1)
    ```

- **[MoverScore](https://github.com/AIPHES/emnlp19-moverscore)**
  - Install: `pip install moverscore`
  - Example usage:
    ```python
    from moverscore import word_mover_score
    score = word_mover_score(["source text"], ["summary"])
    print(score)
    ```

### **3. Compression & Redundancy**
- **N-gram Overlap & Repetition Check (NLTK, SpaCy)**
  - Example using NLTK:
    ```python
    from nltk.util import ngrams
    def get_ngram_overlap(source, summary, n=2):
        source_ngrams = set(ngrams(source.split(), n))
        summary_ngrams = set(ngrams(summary.split(), n))
        return len(summary_ngrams & source_ngrams) / len(summary_ngrams)
    ```

- **Sentence Similarity (TextRank, LexRank)**
  - **TextRank (Gensim)**:
    ```python
    from gensim.summarization import summarize
    summary = summarize("source text")
    print(summary)
    ```

### **4. Coherence & Fluency**
- **[GPT-4 / Llama2 Perplexity Score (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/perplexity)**
  - Example using `transformers`:
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
    import torch

    model_name = "gpt2"
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

    def compute_perplexity(text):
        encodings = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model(**encodings, labels=encodings["input_ids"])
        return torch.exp(outputs.loss).item()

    print(compute_perplexity("summary text"))
    ```

1. Embedding-Based Methods
Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between vector representations of the original text and summary.
BERTScore: Computes similarity using BERT embeddings, considering contextual meaning.
Sentence Mover’s Similarity (SMS): Extends Word Mover’s Distance using sentence embeddings to measure semantic similarity.
2. Information-Based Methods
Compression Ratio: Measures how much the summary compresses the original text.
Coverage: Assesses how much of the original content is retained in the summary.
Repetition Score: Checks redundancy by measuring repeated words/phrases.
3. N-gram Based Methods
ROUGE-L Recall (against original text): Measures how much of the original text’s longest common subsequence appears in the summary.
Coverage & Density: Examines how extractive or abstractive a summary is based on n-gram overlap.
4. Model-Based Methods
QAEval (Question-Answering Evaluation): Generates and answers questions from the original text and summary to compare factual consistency.
SUPERT: Uses sentence embeddings to compare the summary with important sentences from the original text.
AlignScore: Leverages alignment techniques to measure semantic fidelity.
