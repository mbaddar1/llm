Automotive

Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that is designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal.  Model Y is a compact SUV built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults.  Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults.  Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that Tesla offers in a sedan and SUV, respectively.  In November 2023, Tesla entered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has the utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.  In 2022, Tesla also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi.  The company has planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in its proprietary Full Self-Driving ("FSD") Capability features, battery cell and other technologies.   

Energy Storage Products

Tesla's lithium-ion battery energy storage products are Powerwall and Megapack.  Powerwall, which is sold directly to customers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility.  Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility, and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours ("GWh") or greater capacity.  Tesla also continues to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching its energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications, including through its real-time energy control and optimization platforms.   

Solar Energy Offerings

Tesla sells retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also makes them available through power purchase agreement ("PPA") arrangements.  The company purchases most of the components for its retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply.  Tesla also designs and manufactures certain components for its solar energy products.  The company sells its Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel customers.  Tesla continues to improve its installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on new homes.
