"""
To evaluate the quality of summaries without human-generated benchmarks, we define a measure called WESM based on word-embedding using Word Mover's Distance. We show that the orderings of the ROUGE and WESM scores of our algorithms are highly comparable, suggesting that WESM may serve as a viable alternative for measuring the quality of a summary.
